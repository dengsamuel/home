            What is Mayonnaise&#63; Mayonnaise is a creamy sauce that is commonly used as a condiment or dip. Mayonnaise usually contains oil, egg yolk, and either vinegar or lemon juice. It is commonly found in sandwiches like the BLT and mixed with other sauces to create tastier ones. In no particular order, here are some foods that pair well with Mayonnaise.

            <li>Deviled Eggs</li>
            <li>Hamburgers</li>
            <li>Sandwiches</li>
            <li>French Fries</li>
            <li>Grilled Cheese</li>

        <h2 class="center">All About Mayonnaise</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How many eggs do you think the United States produce a year&#63; About 1&#37; of the whopping 8 billion eggs produced annually in the U.S. are used to make Mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>How much Mayonnaise do you think America consumes a year&#63; In 2013, Americans bought approximately 177 million gallons of mayonnaise, which is enough mayo to fill 268 Olympic size swimming pools or two&#45;thirds of the Empire State Building.</li>
            <li>With all the Mayonnaise that America eats, how much money do they spend on it&#63; In 2013, Americans spent 2 billion dollars on mayo, which is more than they spent on any other condiment&#33;</li>
            <li>Many people like healthier, &ldquo;low&#45;fat&rdquo; versions of their favourite foods. However, they are usually full of extra fillers like sugar to help make up for the lost flavour. Unlike many other foods that are marketed towards dieters, low&#45;fat Mayonnaise is actually a healthier choice, as it has less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.</li>

        <h2 class="center" id="history">Mayonnaise&#39;s Unknown Origins</h2>

        <p class="double">    
            Surprisingly, there isn&#39;t a clear, definitive history of Mayonnaise that everyone can agree on. Many secondary sources claim that Mayonnaise was invented in 1756 by the French, after French forces under the command of Duke de Richelieu attacked British&#45;occupied Port Mahon, Menorca &#40;which is part of present&#45;day Spain&#41;, during the Seven Year&#39;s war. Since the island lacked cream necessary for a &ldquo;righteous victory sauce&rdquo;, the Duke&#39;s chef invented an egg and oil dressing called &ldquo;Mahonnaise&rdquo;, which was named after it&#39;s place of birth &#40;another story suggested that the locals on the island gave him a recipe&#41;. The French then liberated the recipe for Mayonnaise from the British, who didn&#39;t even know that they had the recipe under their noses, and took it home with them. 
		<br>
		<br>
			Starting in the early 19th century, the word &ldquo;Mayonnaise&rdquo; began to appear in German and British cookbooks that were dedicated to French cuisine. However, on the other side of the argument, the Spanish argue that there is no mention of Mayonnaise anywhere in French cookbooks before the 19th century. They believe that it is logical to assume the French had gotten the recipe from Menorca back when they had invaded. Many people find this odd, though. How could such as small island like Menorca come up with something as sophisticated as Mayonnaise&#63; They also point out that there is no mention of Mayonnaise coming from Spain in the French cookbooks. So who really invented Mayonnaise&#63; Well, I&#39;ll leave that up to decide, since it is quite a controversial subject.

        <h3  class="center">Hellman&#39;s Mayonnaise</h3>
        <img src="images/mayologo.png" id="logo" alt="Hellmann&#39;s Mayonnaise Logo">
        <p class="double">
            In mid&#45;1905, Richard Hellmann opened his own deli in New York City, where he invented Mayonnaise. He served them in small amounts to customers. It became so popular that he began selling it in bulk to other stores, and was constantly improving the recipe to make it not spoil as quickly. On September 1st, 1905, under the name of &ldquo;Hellmann&#39;s Blue Ribbon Mayonnaise&rdquo;, Richard built a small factory to start selling more Mayonnaise since he was so successful. While Hellmann&#39;s Mayonnaise was very successful on the east coast of the U.S. &#40;they were selling 15 million dollars a year by 1927 with 1 million dollars in profits&#41;, the California company &ldquo;Best Foods&rdquo; introduced their own version of Mayonnaise. So now Hellmann&#39;s had competition. &ldquo;Best Foods&rdquo; Mayonnaise became popular on the West Coast of the U.S. In August of 1927, Best Foods bought the Hellmann&#39;s brand. By then, both brands of Mayonnaise had such large market shares in their respective halves of the country that the Best Foods decided to keep both brands and their respective recipes.

            Now I bet you&#39;re thinking&#58; &ldquo;If a small, undeveloped island like Menorca can make Mayonnaise, then so can I&#33;&rdquo; Well, you&#39;re absolutely right. Mayonnaise is quite easy to make, and this version can be stored for quite a while.
