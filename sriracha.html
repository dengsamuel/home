        <h2 class="center">All About Sriracha Sauce</h2>
        <p>
            From a mysterious rooster on the Sriracha bottles to where the name Sriracha comes from, here are some &#34;hot&#34; facts about Sriracha sauce.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you noticed a picture of a rooster on the Sriracha sauce bottle&#63; Well, the rooster is there, since it symbolizes founder David Tran&#39;s Chinese zodiac sign, the rooster, which conveys accuracy and precision.</li>
            <li>Where does the name Sriracha come from&#63; David Tran named his sauce after a small seaside town in Thailand, called Sri Racha. While Sriracha sauce is now the most popular hot sauce in the world, the town it&#39;s named after is still very small, with a population of about 19,000 people.</li>
            <li>So why does the Sriracha bottle have a green cap&#63; The green cap on the top of each Sriracha bottle is meant to represent the green stem of a chili pepper. Can you see the resemblance&#63; </li>
            <li>Did you know that you can actually get high off of Sriracha sauce&#63; It turns out that when the body ingests a pepper, some elements in a chili pepper trick the nervous system into believing you&#39;ve touched something extremely hot. In an attempt to combat this feeling, your brain releases endorphins, which give the body a natural &#34;high&#34;.</li>

        <h3 id="history" class="center">Sriracha&#39;s Mysterious Origins</h3>
		<img src="images/origin.jpg" alt="Si Racha, Thailand" id="origin">
        <p class="double">
            Like Mayonnaise, Sriracha&#39;s origins are debated, and there is no clear answer as to who invented it. One report says that the sauce was first produced by a Thai woman named Thanom Chakkapak in the town of Sri Racha, Thailand &#40;the place that the sauce was named after&#41;.  However, according to the Thai &#34;Si Racha Lovers&#39; Association&#34;, the sauce was first made in Sri Racha by some sawmill workers. The Thai group interviewed 88&#45;year&#45;old Thawat Wiphisamakun to find our more about the origins of Sriracha Sauce. Thawat&#39;s grandmother owned a small shop in Sri Racha. The sawmill workers often came to the shop to buy chilies, salt, vinegar, and sugar to pound in a mortar to make their version of Sriracha sauce. Eventually, she started making the sauce herself, both for family use, and to sell to customers.

        <h3 class="center">Huy Fong Foods</h3>
		<img src="images/huyfongfoods.jpg" alt="Huy Fong Foods Logo" id="logo">
		<p class="double">
            Currently, the most popular brand of Sriracha sauce in America is Huy Fong Foods. Their Sriracha is sometimes known as &#34;Rooster Sauce&#34; due to an image of a rooster on it. Huy Fong Foods was created in 1980 by Vietnamese&#45;American David Tran. The vibrant red color, distinct plastic bottle, and green cap make it recognizable by many. The Sriracha sauce recipe has not changed significantly since David started his company. Ingredients in their Sriracha sauce include chili, sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite and xanthan gum. Huy Fong Foods makes their Sriracha sauce from fresh red jalape&#241;o chili peppers, and makes sure that their sauce contains no added water or artificial colors. 
        <br>
		<br>
            Production of the chili peppers begins on David&#39;s 1700 acres of farmland, where they are grown during the month of March. The chili peppers are harvested in mid&#45;July through October and are driven from the farm to the Huy Fong Foods processing facility, which is in Irwindale, California. In order to make Sriracha sauce, after the chili peppers are harvested, they are washed, crushed, and mixed with some other ingredients, including sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite &#40;as preservatives&#41;, and Xanthan gum. Normally, all commercially made products are supposed to look identical. However, because David does not add food coloring to the Sriracha sauce, each bottle can vary in color. For example, at the beginning of the harvest season, the chili peppers are greener, so the sauce becomes a lighter red color. Later in the season, the sauce produced becomes bright red, as the chili peppers become redder.

            <li>1 pound of red jalape&#241;o peppers, with their stems cut off</li>
            <li>1&#47;2 pound red serrano peppers, with their stems cut off</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>1&#47;3 cup of water</li>
            <li>1&#47;2 cup of distilled white vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="left">Other things you&#39;ll need&#58;</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>A Blender</li>
            <li>A Knife</li>
            <li>A Large, glass container</li>
            <li>A Wooden Spoon</li>
            <li>A Strainer</li>
            <li>A Saucepan</li>
            <li>Plastic Wrap</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="left">Instructions&#58;</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the jalape&#241;o and serrano peppers, retaining their seeds and membranes, and place into a blender with garlic, brown sugar, salt, and water. Blend until smooth, pulsing several times to start.</li>
            <li>Transfer the puree into a large glass container such as a large jar or pitcher. Cover the container with plastic wrap and place into a cool dark location for 3 to 5 days, stirring once a day. The mixture will begin to bubble and ferment. Scrape down the sides during each stirring. Rewrap after every stirring and return to a cool, dark place until the mixture is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Pour the fermented mixture back into blender with vinegar&#59; blend until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine&#45;mesh strainer into a saucepan, pushing as much of the pulp as possible through the strainer into the sauce. Discard the remaining pulp, seeds, and skin left in the strainer.</li>
            <li>Place the saucepan on a burner and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring often, until reduced to your desired thickness, which should take about 5 to 10 minutes. Skim the foam if desired.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let the sauce cool to room temperature. The sauce will thicken a little when cooled. Transfer the sauce to jars or bottles and refrigerate.</li>
